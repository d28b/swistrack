The projects were compiled and upgraded to Visual Studio 2008.
You can however make it backward compatible by just editing the header of the .vcproj and .sln files.

.sln file
Microsoft Visual Studio Solution File, Format Version 10.00
# Visual Studio 2008

Edit to

Microsoft Visual Studio Solution File, Format Version 9.00
# Visual Studio 2005

.vcproj files
	Version="9.00"

Edit to

	Version="8.00"
	

Whith those modifications, these files are made backward compatible with the 2005 Visual Studio version.
