SwisTrack 4 NMEA Parser and Example
===================================


How to Run the Example

Type
	make
to compile the sample program "example-stdin". (Note that you need a C++ compiler set up on your machine.)

Once this is done, you can run it with
	./example-stdin
The program is pretty self-explanatory.

You need to integrate the following 4 files in your project:
	CommunicationMessage.h
	CommunicationMessage.cpp

	CommunicationNMEAInterface.cpp
How to use them is explained in "example-stdin.cpp".
