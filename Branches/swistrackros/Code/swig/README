This is the beginning of a swig wrapper for swistrack.  The test case
shows how to instantiate a pipeline and step it forwards, getting an
IplImage at each step.  You can then call any of the openCV functions
on it, or display it in a gui, or whatever you want.

I was going ot use it to make a QT4 video player in python, but had
trouble converting it to something that Qt could display.  Qt4.5 is
going to read RGB 888, which is the default format of an IplImage but
4.3 doesn't do it yet.  It's tricky because a QImage is a SIP python
object, while everything else in the universe uses Swig.

It does *not* yet support writing swistrack plugins in python.  It
lets you call swistrack from python, but not python from swistrack.
